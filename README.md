# BooksElasticsearch
This is the project done to demonstrate the elasticsearch behaviour


The program is to create index of Each pdf file in elasticsearch using Python
Here I have imported the required package

    -> Elasticsearch for creating and searching indexes

    -> os and glob to set directory and get the access to all pdf files directory

    -> PyPDF2 is the key to read all pdf files

    -> And Pandas is the package to create dataframe from readed text
